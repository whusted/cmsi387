## Points to Ponder

#####1. Why did the cd command get special mention in this assignment? 
##### 2. Can your shell run scripts? Why or why not? 
##### 3. Does Ctrl-D exit your shell? Why or why not?
###### No, Ctrl-D does not exit my shell; instead, it puts it into an infinite loop of constantly calling the last command that was inputed.
