  <h2>Install and Build an Ubuntu Kernel</h2>
    <p>
      1. The <b>first</b> step is to download and install the latest Ubuntu desktop,
      which can be done <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">here</a>. When asked to choose a "flavor", I chose 32-bit and the rest of this how-to will assume you have done the same, although many of the instructions will be similar with small tweaks if you choose 64-bit.
      <br>
      <br>
      The <b>second</b> step is to obtain the source code for the latest Ubuntu kernel.
      <br>
      In your virtual machine's terminal, enter:
      <br>
      <h4><code>git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-&ltrelease&gt.git</code></h4>
      <br>
      In my case, <code>release</code> was <code>ubuntu-trusty</code> but modifications and updates happen frequently to Ubuntu so check to make sure you have the latest stable version.
      <br>
      <br>
      It will take some time for the source download. When it has finished, there will be a folder in your current working directory (found by typing <code>pwd</code>) called <code>ubuntu-&ltrelease&gt</code> with <code>release</code> replaced by the latest install.
      <br>
      <br>
      2. The <b>second</b> step is to install certain packages needed to build a kernel, which is done by exectuing the following command:
      <br>
      <h4><code>sudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)</code></h4>
      You now have the source code and have installed the proper packages for the build environment.
      <br>
      <br>
      3. The <b>third</b> step is to build the kernel. Navigate your working directory to the kernel source code folder and execute the following commands:
      <br>
      <h4>
      	  <code>
      	  fakeroot debian/rules clean
      	  <br>
          fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic
          </code>
      </h4>
      Assuming now errors were produced, you can now install your kernel by executing the following command:
      <h4><code>sudo dpkg -i linux*&ltcurrent-version&gt*.deb</code></h4>
      <br>
      Replace <code>&ltcurrent-version&gt</code> with the string of numbers found in your <code>.deb</code> files that are located in the directory above your source directory.
      <br>
      Finally, <code>sudo reboot</code> will reboot your machine.
    </p>
  <h2>How to Build Your Own System Call</h2>
  <p>
    Follow these instructions to add your own custom system call to a 32-bit version of Ubuntu 13.12. Again, the version of your kernel will likely be different, but the general procedure is the same.
    <br>
    <br>
    1. <b>First</b>, there are files that need to be created to add a custom system call. In your root folder of the kernel source code, create a new directory. I called mine <code>hello_world/</code>
    <br>
    <br>
    Here's where my directory lies:
    <h4><code>ubuntu-trusty/hello_world/</code></h4>
    In the directory you just made, create a .c file - I called mine <code>sys_hello.c</code>
    <br>
    To create a Spanish version of "Hello world", I entered the following into <code>sys_hello.c</code>:
    <h4>
      <code>
    	#include &ltlinux/kernel.h&gt
    	<br>
    	<br>
        asmlinkage long sys_hello(void) {
        <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspprintk(KERN_EMERG "Hola Mundo.");
            <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn 0;
            <br>
	    }
      </code>
    </h4>
     <code>printk</code> prints out the log messages of the kernel. <code>KERN_EMERG</code> logs messages that are considered to be an emergency. This is not necessary to add.
    <br>
    <br>
    Next, you need to create a new Makefile. In this case, you need to specify the <code>.o</code> object file that will be produced when the <code>sys_hello.c</code> file compiles.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Makefile should be located in the directory you created - in my case, it lies here:
    <br>
    <h4><code>ubuntu-trusty/hello_world/Makefile</code></h4>
    Inside the file, all you need is this:

    <h4><code>obj-y := sys_hello.o</code></h4>
    <br>
    2. <b>Second</b>, there are system files that need to be modified.
    Navigate to:
    <h4><code>ubuntu-trusty/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl</code></h4>
    or whatever your equivalent version is.
    <br>
    At the end of <code>syscall_32.tbl</code> you will notice something like:
    <h4><code>350&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi386&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfinit_module&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsys_finit_module</code></h4>
    You need to add another entry into the table file right below the last entry with the exact same format of the previous entries.
    Mine looked like this:
    <h4>
    	<code>351&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi386&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsys_hello&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsys_hello</code>
    </h4>

    The second file to modify is:
    <h4><code>ubuntu-trusty/include/linux/syscalls.h</code></h4>
    There will be a list of wrapper functions of the system calls available. Right before the <code>#endif</code>, add your custom wrapper function. Mine looked like this, with context provided of where to place your function:

    <h4>
    	<code>
    		asmlinkage long sys_kcmp(pid_t pid1, pid_t pid2, int type, unsigned long idx1, unsigned long idx2);
    		<br>
 asmlinkage long sys_finit_module(int fd, const char __user *uargs, int flags);
            <br>
    		<br>

asmlinkage long sys_kcmp(pid_t pid1, pid_t pid2, int type, unsigned long idx1, unsigned long idx2);
            <br>
asmlinkage long sys_hello(void);
            <br>
 #endif

    	</code>
    </h4>

     The third file to modify is:
    <h4><code>ubuntu-trusty/Makefile</code></h4>
    Locate a line that looks like this:
    <h4><code>core-y&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp+= kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/</code></h4>
    You need to add the directory you created that contains your custom system call.
    <br>
    Appending the directory to the end of the list, mine looked like this:
    <h4><code>core-y&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp+= kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ hello_world/</code></h4>
    This line tells the kernel that, when building, look into the <code>hello_world/</code> directory to access our custom system call.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is now time to <b>test your custom system call</b>.
    <br>
    First, rebuild and install your kernel by following the directions above. Again, this may take quite a while.
    <br>
    <br>
    When your kernel installs, execute <code>sudo reboot</code> and continuously type the shift key while your machine reboots. You will be given a boot loader menu with options of which kernel to load. Choose the most recent kernel, most likely the one at the top of the menu.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once you have logged in, create a <code>.c</code> file (the name doesn't matter). I called mine <code>test_sys_call.c</code>
    <br>
    Inside the newly created file, write:
    <h4>
        <code>
        	#include &ltstdio.h&gt
        	<br>
            #include &ltlinux/kernel.h&gt
            <br>
            #include &ltsys/syscall.h&gt
            <br>
            #include &ltunistd.h&gt
            <br>
            <br>
            long hello_syscall(void) {
            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn syscall(351);
            <br>
            }
            <br>
            <br>
            int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplong int a = hello_syscall();
            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspprintf("System call returned %ld\n", a);
            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn 0;
            <br>
            }
        </code>

    </h4>
    The hardcoded 351 is the custom system call. Keep in mind you may have a different (probably slightly larger) number.
    <br>
    Next, compile and run your <code>.c</code> program:
    <h4><code>gcc -o sys_hello test_sys_call.c &amp&amp ./sys_hello</code></h4>
    To see your custom system call in action, execute the command
    <h4><code>dmesg</code></h4>
    One of the most recent logs should contain your system call.
    <br>
